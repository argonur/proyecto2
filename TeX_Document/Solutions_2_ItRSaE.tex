\section{Exercises of Chapter 2}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item {\bf Discuss the dichotomy of rocket science in the modern era.}\\
	
The first dichotomy starts after WWI, with the Treaty of Versailles that prohibited Germany to develop long-range artillery and the NAZI Germany developed the V2 (\textit{Vergeltungswaffe 2}), that was a missile capable of reaching an objective 300 km away from the launch place. The ''success'' of this lethal weapon, led the governments of the Soviet Union and USA to start developing their own missiles.

The second dichotomy happens when the Soviets where the firsts to place a satellite in orbit (Sputnik), and with this, the space era started. The objective of building rockets was not anymore only military, but it was also scientific and even commercial. 

	\item {\bf In your own words give a definition for a rocket mission.}\\
	
A mission is the objective that the government of a country or a private organization has for which a rocket is needed to be accomplished. Examples are; putting a satellite in GEO, sending a robot to Mars to make experiments, sending a missile with an atomic bomb to an asteroid that is going to impact our beautiful home planet.
	
	\item {\bf What is a payload?}\\
	
The payload is the equipment that solves the problem represented by the mission. In other words, the payload is how the mission is intended to be accomplished.

For the mission \lq\lq{}putting a satellite in GEO\rq\rq{}, the payload is the satellite.\\
For the mission \lq\lq{}sending a robot to Mars to make experiments\rq\rq{}, the payload is the robot.\\
For the mission \lq\lq{}sending a missile with an atomic bomb to an asteroid that is going to impact our beautiful home planet\rq\rq{}, the payload is the bomb.

The payload is the all hardware above the launch vehicle, except the protective fairing, which is also part of the launch vehicle. 
	
	\item {\bf What is the so-called “SMAD”?}\\
	
SMAD stands for \textit{Space Mission Analysis and Preparation}, and it is the name of book, that according to \cite{book}, is the standard text book for space mission preparation.
	
	\item {\bf Give the four basic assumptions required for understanding the basics of projectile motion.}\\
	
\begin{enumerate}
1. Acceleration due to gravity is constant\\
2. No air resistance\\
3. Earth is flat\\
4. Earth’s rotation has no impact on the motion of the projectile.
\end{enumerate}
	
	\item {\bf Define MECO.}\\
	
MECO stands for main engine cutoff, and it happens when the main engine is turned off, it can be because all the propellant has been used, or also in a multistage rocket it can be that the first stage that contains the main engine still has propellant which is going to be used for the landing of the first stage.
	
	\item {\bf Equation 2.9 gives the parabolic flight path of a rocket trajectory as height, \textit{y}, as a function of range, \textit{x}, or \textit{y(x)}. Use the quadratic equation to solve for \textit{x} as a function of \textit{y} to give a range equation as a function of height.}\\
	
	\item {\bf A rocket is launched with a burnout velocity of 75 m/sec, burnout altitude of 300 m, and a burnout range of 100 m. Assuming a flight path angle of 75\degree, calculate the final range of the rocket when it impacts the ground.}\\
	
	\item {\bf Calculate the maximum altitude reached by the rocket in Exercise 8.}\\

	\item {\bf Redo Exercise 8 to determine the range at MECO altitude. What is the range at MECO if the initial flight path angle is 15\degree ?}\\
	
\end{enumerate}
